ThinkStats2
===========

My repository covering the book ThinkStats2 by Allen Downey.

The original repository did not have a requirement.txt or a virtual env, so I add them.

Before preceding to any of the code please activate a virtual environment and run:

"pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
 
This will install the dependencies for the code contained in this repository.

Text and supporting code for [Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)
